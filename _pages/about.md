### About Me

Greetings! I'm Chaoran, a Chinese expat currently calling Singapore home. In a past life, I delved into the world of engineering, wielding a B.Eng in Chemical Engineering and an M.Sc. in Industrial Engineering. However, somewhere along the way, I found myself falling head over heels for the enchanting realm of Data Science.


### About this Blog

Welcome to my digital domain, a haven I established back in Jan 2015 as I embarked on my journey into the depths of data science. Picture this: me, navigating through countless online courses, Quora threads, websites, and textbooks, feeling like a modern-day Magellan charting new territories.

Why did I start this blog? Well, it dawned on me that the best way to cement my newfound knowledge was to document it. Thus, this blog serves as a testament to my learning odyssey and a treasure trove of insights and discoveries I've unearthed along the way.

I firmly believe that knowledge is most potent when shared. So, whether you're a fellow data science enthusiast or simply curious, I hope my musings and findings spark a flicker of enlightenment in your journey. After all, we're all in this wondrous world of data together!
