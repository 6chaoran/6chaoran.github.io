    title: "MedDoc Parser"
    excerpt: | 
      In Singapore, I've noticed a common challenge: our medical lab reports are often still in non-digital formats, making it tough to manage our health data effectively. Inspired by this, I've developed a web app, which allows users to effortlessly convert photos of their medical reports into organized tables, enabling easier analysis of the health history. I'm excited to share this tool, hoping it can help others navigate their health journeys with greater ease.
